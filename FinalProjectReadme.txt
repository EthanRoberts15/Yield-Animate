Our code takes data from the excel sheet and plots it on a graph. This data is the average corn yield from a field near my house. Our code
can scroll through the seasons using the scroll function. If the 'Soybeans' button is pressed, the data is displayed again but converted to
an estimate of what the average soybean yield would have been for that field if soybeans had been planted instead. The same action is performed
for milo estimated yield.
